> It was an interdisciplinary unit for the major of Data Science at the University of Sydney. The disciplines involved in this project were medicine and data science. 

__Domain Knowledge__

One in 1400 Australians will be on dialysis or live with a transplanted kidney in their lifetime. On average, it takes a patient 3 years to get started on the treatment. In 2016, 42% of the patients were on the waiting list, yet to be allocated a transplant. In 2017, 15% of the transplantees experienced acute rejection.

__Responsibilities__
- Collaborated with a nephrologist at Westmead Hospital and four students majoring in data science at USYD
- Co-developed an integrated statistical solution to address the interdisciplinary problem
  1. Problem: How to strike a balance between the maximisation of graft utility and the equity issues when allocating grafts
  2. Stakeholders: nephrologists and patients suffering from chronic kidney disease
  3. Solution: A risk calculator that predicts the probability of acute rejection and the survival of a graft in the form of a Shiny app.

__Achievement__
- Received a HD in this unit
