> Often times, gene expression data is used to help develop models in order to predict a patientâ€™s rejection status after receiving a kidney transplant.

__Background__

Three machine learning algorithms are investigated, k-nearest neighbours, random forest and support vector machine. In order to find the top performing algorithm that works the best on gene expression data, 5-fold cross validation is repeated 25 times and two evaluation metrics, accuracy and F1 score, are calculated to assess the performance of each classifier.
